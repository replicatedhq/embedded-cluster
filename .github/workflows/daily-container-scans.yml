# Container Security Scans
# This workflow orchestrates security scanning of container images using Anchore scanner.
# It runs nightly and can be triggered manually to scan various container images for vulnerabilities.
name: Container Security Scans

# Trigger configuration
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Runs nightly at midnight (UTC)
  workflow_dispatch:      # Allows manual triggering through GitHub UI

# Security hardening: Start with no permissions and grant only what's needed
permissions: {}  # Remove all permissions by default

# Prevent multiple workflow runs from interfering with each other
# This ensures only one scan runs at a time and new triggers cancel old runs
