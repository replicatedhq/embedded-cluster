# Clean Code

Essential clean code principles for Go development in Embedded Cluster.

## File Formatting

### End of File
- **Always leave a single newline at the end of every file**
- This ensures proper POSIX compliance and clean git diffs

## Comments

### Keep Comments Concise
- **Comments should be brief and to the point**
- Explain *why*, not *what* the code does
- Avoid redundant comments that just repeat the code

### Function Comments
- Use concise godoc format for exported functions
- Focus on purpose and important behavior
- Single line comments for simple functions

### Inline Comments
- Use sparingly for complex logic
- Keep on same line when possible for short explanations
